#Sharing
Blynk offers two types of sharing your projects with other people:

- **Share access to your hardware.** Think about giving someone an App for your Project. They can't modify, but can control and see what's there.

- **Share your Project configuration.** Others will get a clone of your project by scanning a given QR link, but they won't be able to control your hardware. It's great for tutorials, instructables, etc.

## Shared access to your hardware
Imagine giving someone an App to control your Project.

- people you’ve shared your project with can’t modify anything. They can only use it
- you can update your app, change the layout, add widgets and it’s immediately synced to everyone
- you can revoke access at any moment

How it works:
- you send the QR code to your users (you can email, print, post to social media, do whatever you want)
- others download Blynk app, scan the QR code and your app opens for them ready to use. They don’t even need to login or create an account.

Go to your Project's Settings:

Click on "Generate Link" button :

It will generate QR code you can share with others:

That's it! Now **Exit the settings and press PLAY button.**

Another person would need to install Blynk app and scan QR code from the login screen (scanning from existing profile is not yet supported) ;

**NOTE:** Your Project should be active, don't forget to press Play button.

**WARNING:** Sharing costs 1000 energy and this energy is not recoverable even you didn't use sharing at all.


## Share your Project configuration
In case you want to share your Project's set up without giving access to your hardware (for example to make a tutorial or instructable)- follow the steps: 

In Project's Settings go to **Clone** button.

<img src="images/clone.png" style="width: 200px; height:360px"/>

It will generate QR code you can share with anyone.

<img src="images/QR.png" style="width: 200px; height:360px"/>

Another person **should Log In to Blynk app** and press QR button in Projects gallery

<img src="images/QR_button_edit.png" style="width: 200px; height:360px"/>

After the scan, a new Project will be created, all the widgets, settings, layout will be cloned. Another person would need enough Energy Balance to clone your Project.

**Auth Token will be different!**. Nobody will get access to your hardware. They just get a copy of the layout and settings.
